1. Reflection
Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: When I use a computer other than the one I would normally use and when 
the project is being aded to by other people.

2. Reflection
Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: Some changes, although relevant, may not be needed or wanted
on the remote repository. Some changes may have introduced bug, or there
were so many that it would be tiresome to have had the changes automatically
pulled one by one. The search for a particular one would get confusing.
