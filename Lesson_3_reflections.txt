1. Reflection
Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: When I use a computer other than the one I would normally use and when 
the project is being aded to by other people.

2. Reflection
Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: Some changes, although relevant, may not be needed or wanted
on the remote repository. Some changes may have introduced bug, or there
were so many that it would be tiresome to have had the changes automatically
pulled one by one. The search for a particular one would get confusing.


3. Reflection
Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Answer: Forks allow to clone someone's repository to another via Github.
Clones allows to copy a repository from Github to a local repository.
Branches allow to copy the work of one branch and copy it to another.

One would use branching if working on a large project and wanted to make
experimental changes that could change the whole project for good or 
ruin it.

One would use cloning when they wanted to make changes to someone else's
repository. Where using cloning they could get that person's repository on
their own machine.

One would use forks, when they wanted the project that someone else
made and make changes to it.
